# 🌦️ Real-Time Weather Simulation using OpenWeatherMap and Unreal Engine

## 📘 Overview
This project integrates the **OpenWeatherMap API** with **Unreal Engine** and the **Ultra Dynamic Sky** system to create a **real-time, location-based weather simulation**.  
By fetching live weather data for any specified location, the Unreal environment dynamically replicates realistic atmospheric conditions such as temperature, cloud coverage, rain, wind, and lighting.

## 🚀 Features
- 🌍 **Live Weather Fetching:** Retrieve current weather data using OpenWeatherMap’s API.  
- ☁️ **Dynamic Sky Updates:** Automatically adjust Ultra Dynamic Sky parameters based on real weather inputs.  
- 🌅 **Time & Lighting Sync:** Optionally synchronize environment lighting and time of day with the target location.  
- ⚙️ **Blueprint + C++ Integration:** Combines Unreal’s visual scripting with API-based data handling.  
- 💡 **Customizable Mappings:** Developers can tweak how weather parameters affect visuals for unique effects.
